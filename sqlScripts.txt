While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture. Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme. Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row. Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.

Bring aluminum foil over top of turkey and seal; try to keep foil from touching turkey. Bake turkey in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours until juices run clear. Uncover turkey and continue baking until skin turns golden brown, 30 minutes to 1 hour longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove turkey from the oven, cover with two sheets of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes.",

Remove from the oven and let sit on a wire rack until completely cool. Leave the oven on. While the crust is cooling, beat cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until smooth. Add sugar, sour cream, and vanilla. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl and continue to beat until combined. Gently whisk one egg with a fork in a small bowl; add to the cream cheese mixture and beat just until combined. Repeat with each remaining egg, whisking and adding just one at a time. Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan and move it to the lower rack of the oven. Pour 2 inches of boiling water into the roasting pan. Bake cheesecake until edges are puffed and surface is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 ½ hours. Tent the cheesecake with a sheet of foil if the top is browning too much during baking.",
